# # Project 2: Movie Classification

# # Part 1: The Dataset
# 
# We are exploring movie screenplays in this project, trying to predict each movie's genre from the text of its screenplay. In particular, we have compiled a list of 5,000 words that occur in conversations between movie characters. For each movie, our dataset tells us the frequency with which each of these words occurs in certain conversations in its screenplay. All words have been converted to lowercase.
# 
# The following code when run reads `movies` table. **It may take up to a minute to load.**

# In[72]:


movies = Table.read_table('movies.csv')


# Here are one of the rows of the table and some of the frequencies of words that were said in the movie.

# In[73]:


movies.where("Title", "runaway bride").select(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 14, 49, 1042, 4004)


# The above cell prints a few columns of the row for the comedy movie Runaway Bride. The movie contains 4895 words. The word "it" appears 115 times, as it makes up of the words in the movie. The word "england" doesn't appear at all.
# 
# Additional context: This numerical representation of a body of text, one that describes only the frequencies of individual words, is called a bag-of-words representation. This is a model that is often used in NLP. A lot of information is discarded in this representation: the order of the words, the context of each word, who said what, the cast of characters and actors, etc. However, a bag-of-words representation is often used for machine learning applications as a reasonable starting point, because a great deal of information is also retained and expressed in a convenient and compact format.
# 
# In this project, we will investigate whether this representation is sufficient to build an accurate genre classifier.

# All movie titles are unique. The `row_for_title` function provides fast access to the one row for each title. 
# 
# *Note: All movies in our dataset have their titles lower-cased.* 

# In[74]:


title_index = movies.index_by('Title')
def row_for_title(title):
    """Return the row for a title, similar to the following expression (but faster)

    movies.where('Title', title).row(0)
    """
    return title_index.get(title)[0]

row_for_title('toy story')


# For example, the fastest way to find the frequency of "fun" in the movie *Toy Story* is to access the `'fun'` item from its row. Check the original table to see if this worked for you!

# In[75]:


row_for_title('toy story').item('fun')


# Question 1.0
# Set expected_row_sum to the number that you expect will result from summing all proportions in each row, excluding the first five columns. Think about what any one row adds up to.

# In[76]:


# Set row_sum to a number that's the (approximate) sum of each row of word proportions.
expected_row_sum = 1



# This dataset was extracted from a dataset from Cornell University. After transforming the dataset (e.g., converting the words to lowercase, removing the naughty words, and converting the counts to frequencies), we created this new dataset containing the frequency of 5000 common words in each movie.
# 
# 

# In[77]:


print('Words with frequencies:', movies.drop(np.arange(5)).num_columns) 
print('Movies with genres:', movies.num_rows)


# 1.1. Word Stemming
# The columns other than "Title", "Year", "Rating", "Genre", and "# Words" in the movies table are all words that appear in some of the movies in our dataset. These words have been stemmed, or abbreviated heuristically, in an attempt to make different inflected forms of the same base word into the same string. For example, the column "manag" is the sum of proportions of the words "manage", "manager", "managed", and "managerial" (and perhaps others) in each movie. This is a common technique used in machine learning and natural language processing.
# 
# Stemming makes it a little tricky to search for the words you want to use, so we have provided another table called vocab_table that will let you see examples of unstemmed versions of each stemmed word. Run the code below to load it.
# 
# Note: You should use vocab_table for the rest of Section 1.1, not vocab_mapping.

# In[78]:


# Just run this cell.
vocab_mapping = Table.read_table('stem.csv')
stemmed = np.take(movies.labels, np.arange(3, len(movies.labels)))
vocab_table = Table().with_column('Stem', stemmed).join('Stem', vocab_mapping)
vocab_table.take(np.arange(1100, 1110))


# #### Question 1.1.1
# Using `vocab_table`, find the stemmed version of the word "elements" and assign the value to `stemmed_message`.
# 

# In[79]:


stemmed_message = vocab_table.where("Word", are.equal_to("elements")).column("Stem").item(0)

# #### Question 1.1.2
# What stem in the dataset has the most words that are shortened to it? Assign `most_stem` to that stem. 

# In[80]:


most_stem = vocab_table.group("Stem").sort("count", descending = True).column("Stem").item(0)
most_stem


# 
# What is the longest word in the dataset whose stem wasn't shortened? Assign that to longest_uncut. Break ties alphabetically from Z to A (so if your options are "cat" or "bat", you should pick "cat"). Note that when sorting letters, the letter a is smaller than the letter z. You may also want to sort more than once.

# In[81]:


tbl_with_lens = vocab_table.with_column("lens of word", vocab_table.apply(len, "Word")).with_column("lens of stem", vocab_table.apply(len, "Stem"))

longest_uncut

tbl_with_diff


# #### Question 1.1.4
# How many stems have only one word that is shortened to them? For example, if the stem "book" only maps to the word "books" and if the stem "a" only maps to the word "a," both should be counted as stems that map only to a single word.
# 
# Assign `count_single_stems` to the count of stems that map to one word only. 

# In[82]:


count_single_stems = np.count_nonzero(tbl_with_diff.column("difference between those lengths") <= 0)
count_single_stems


# ## 1.2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Linear Regression

# Let's explore our dataset before trying to build a classifier. To start, weâ€™ll use the associated proportions to investigate the relationship between different words.
# 
# The first association we'll investigate is the association between the proportion of words that are "outer" and the proportion of words that are "space".
# 
# As usual, we'll investigate our data visually before performing any numerical analysis.
# 
# Run the cell below to plot a scatter diagram of "space" proportions vs "outer" proportions and to create the outer_space table. Each point on the scatter plot represents one movie.
# 
# 

# In[83]:


# Just run this cell!
outer_space = movies.select("outer", "space")
outer_space.scatter("outer", "space")
plots.axis([-0.0005, 0.001, -0.0005, 0.003]);
plots.xticks(rotation=45);

movies


# 
# Looking at that chart it is difficult to see if there is an association. Calculate the correlation coefficient for the potential linear association between proportion of words that are "outer" and the proportion of words that are "space" for every movie in the dataset, and assign it to `outer_space_r`. 

# In[84]:


# These two arrays should make your code cleaner!
outer = movies.column("outer")
space = movies.column("space")

Please do not pick "outer" and "space" or "san" and "francisco". The code to plot the scatter plot and line of best fit is given for you, you just need to calculate the correct values to `r`, `slope` and `intercept`. 

# In[85]:

plots.plot([0, max_x * 1.3], [intercept, intercept + slope * (max_x*1.3)], color='gold');


# Question 1.2.3
# Imagine that you picked the words "san" and "francisco" as the two words that you would expect to be correlated because they compose the city name San Francisco. Assign san_francisco to either the number 1 or the number 2 according to which statement is true regarding the correlation between "san" and "francisco."
# 
# "san" can also precede other city names like San Diego and San Jose. This might lead to "san" appearing in movies without "francisco," and would reduce the correlation between "san" and "francisco."
# "san" can also precede other city names like San Diego and San Jose. The fact that "san" could appear more often in front of different cities and without "francisco" would increase the correlation between "san" and "francisco."

# In[86]:


san_francisco = 1


# ## 1.3. Splitting the dataset
# Now, we're going to use our `movies` dataset for two purposes.
# 
# 1. First, we want to *train* movie genre classifiers.
# 2. Second, we want to *test* the performance of our classifiers. 
# 
# Hence, we need two different datasets: *training* and *test*. 
# 
# The purpose of a classifier is to classify unseen data that is similar to the training data. The test dataset will help us determine the accuracy of our predictions by comparing the actual genres of the movies with the genres that our classifier predicts. Therefore, we must ensure that there are no movies that appear in both sets. We do so by splitting the dataset randomly. The dataset has already been permuted randomly, so it's easy to split.  We just take the first 85% of the dataset for training and the rest for test. 
# 
# Run the code below (without changing it) to separate the datasets into two tables.

# In[87]:


# Here we have defined the proportion of our data
# that we want to designate for training as 17/20ths (85%) 
# and, of our total dataset 3/20ths (15%) of the data is
# reserved for testing

training_proportion = 17/20

num_movies = movies.num_rows
num_train = int(num_movies * training_proportion)
num_test = num_movies - num_train

train_movies = movies.take(np.arange(num_train))
test_movies = movies.take(np.arange(num_train, num_movies))

print("Training: ",   train_movies.num_rows, ";",
      "Test: ",       test_movies.num_rows)


train_movies


# Draw a horizontal bar chart with two bars that show the proportion of Comedy movies in each dataset (`train_movies` and `test_movies`). The two bars should be labeled "Training" and "Test". Complete the function `comedy_proportion` first; it should help you create the bar chart. 

# In[88]:


def comedy_proportion(table):
    # Return the proportion of movies in a table that have the comedy genre.
    comedy_prop = table.where("Genre", are.equal_to("comedy")).num_rows/ table.num_rows
    return comedy_prop

com_prop = Table().with_column("Training / Test", make_array("Training", "Test")).with_column("proportions", make_array(comedy_proportion(train_movies), comedy_proportion(test_movies)))


# The staff solution took multiple lines.  Start by creating a table.
# If you get stuck, think about what sort of table you need for barh to work
com_prop.barh("Training / Test", "proportions")


# <!-- END QUESTION -->
# 
# # Part 2: K-Nearest Neighbors - A Guided Example
# 
# K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) is a classification algorithm.  Given some numerical *attributes* (also called *features*) of an unseen example, it decides which category that example belongs to based on its similarity to previously seen examples. Predicting the category of an example is called *labeling*, and the predicted category is also called a *label*.
# 
# An attribute (feature) we have about each movie is *the proportion of times a particular word appears in the movie*, and the labels are two movie genres: comedy and thriller.  The algorithm requires many previously seen examples for which both the attributes and labels are known: that's the `train_movies` table.
# 
# To build understanding, we're going to visualize the algorithm instead of just describing it.

# ## 2.1. Classifying a movie
# 
# In k-NN, we classify a movie by finding the `k` movies in the *training set* that are most similar according to the features we choose. We call those movies with similar features the *nearest neighbors*.  The k-NN algorithm assigns the movie to the most common category among its `k` nearest neighbors.
# 
# Let's limit ourselves to just 2 features for now, so we can plot each movie.  The features we will use are the proportions of the words "water" and "feel" in the movie.  Taking the movie *Monty Python and the Holy Grail* (in the test set), 0.000804074 of its words are "water" and 0.0010721 are "feel". This movie appears in the test set, so let's imagine that we don't yet know its genre.
# 
# First, we need to make our notion of similarity more precise.  **We will say that the *distance* between two movies is the straight-line distance between them when we plot their features on a scatter diagram.**
# 
# **This distance is called the Euclidean ("yoo-KLID-ee-un") distance, whose formula is $\sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2}$.**
# 
# For example, in the movie *Clerks.* (in the training set), 0.00016293 of all the words in the movie are "water" and 0.00154786 are "feel".  Its distance from *Monty Python and the Holy Grail* on this 2-word feature set is $\sqrt{(0.000804074 - 0.000162933)^2 + (0.0010721 - 0.00154786)^2} \approx 0.000798379$.  (If we included more or different features, the distance could be different.)
# 
# A third movie, *The Godfather* (in the training set), has 0 "water" and 0.00015122 "feel". 
# 
# The function below creates a plot to display the "water" and "feel" features of a test movie and some training movies. As you can see in the result, *Monty Python and the Holy Grail* is more similar to *Clerks.* than to the *The Godfather* based on these features, which makes sense as both movies are comedy movies, while *The Godfather* is a thriller.
