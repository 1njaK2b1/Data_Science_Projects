# üé¨ Movie Classification Project

## üìñ Overview
This project implements a **machine learning model** to classify movies based on their attributes such as genre, ratings, and other metadata.  
It demonstrates the complete **data science workflow** ‚Äî from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training and evaluation ‚Äî using **Python** and **scikit-learn**.

The primary goal is to **build and evaluate a classifier** that predicts movie categories efficiently, while following good practices for **reproducibility** and **documentation**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning of raw movie datasets  
- Feature engineering to prepare data for machine learning models  
- Model training using classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix  
- Well-documented code for educational and portfolio purposes
