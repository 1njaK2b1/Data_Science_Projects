# 🧪 Reproducibility Instructions — Movie Classification Project

This document provides detailed steps to **reproduce the results** from the `movies.ipynb` notebook.  
It ensures that anyone can rerun the workflow and obtain the same model performance and outputs.

---

## 📁 Project Overview

The `movies.ipynb` notebook performs the following:
1. Loads and explores movie datasets (`movies.csv`, `friend_movies.csv`, `steam.csv`).
2. Preprocesses and cleans data (handles missing values, encodes features, normalizes inputs).
3. Trains a machine learning classifier to predict movie categories or genres.
4. Evaluates performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix.
